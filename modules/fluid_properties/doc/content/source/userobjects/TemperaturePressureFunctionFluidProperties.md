# TemperaturePressureFunctionFluidProperties

Fluid properties provided as multiple-variable  functions of temperature, pressure that are parameterized
in time, where $t$ is used to indicate temperature and &p& is used to indicate pressure.
This source is made so it is allowed to take in both specific volume, internal energy formulations
and temperature, pressure formulations. The Density, Viscosity and thermal conductivity time derivative
are found by taking the gradient by using pressure and temperature as inputs.

!alert note The range of validity is based off of the validity of the functions
that are input

!alert note The derivative of density do not carry derivative information for automatic differentiation
